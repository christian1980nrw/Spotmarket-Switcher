#  Note:
#   aWATTar: Provides only germany DE-LU or Austrian AT prices, but no API key is needed.
#   Entsoe:  Many more countrys available but free API key needed, see https://www.entsoe.eu/data/map/

# Include prices for the next day in calculations:
# 0 = No (use only today's prices), 1 = Yes (use today's and tomorrow's prices when available (today in the afternoon)).
include_second_day=0
# Note: If you activate this and the prices decrease over several days,
# it is possible that there will be no charging or switching for several days until the lowest prices are reached.

# Solar energy thresholds to abort operations:
# If the expected solar energy (in megajoules per square meter) exceeds these values,

# To find the kilowatt hour value from megajoules, divide by 3.6.

#######################
# Economic Logic Settings
#######################

# Economic Check (economic_check):
# This setting determines whether the system should consider the economic feasibility of charging the battery based on current and projected electricity prices.
# Options:
# 0 = Disable economic checks. The system will charge the battery regardless of the cost implications according to the config matrix.
# 1 = Enable economic checks against the highest price. Charging will only occur if the total cost (current price + energy loss + battery lifecycle costs) is lower than the highest price observed in the current price set.
# 2 = Enable economic checks against the average price. Charging will only occur if the total cost is lower than the average price of electricity.
# Example: If set to 1, and the highest price of the day is lower than the sum of the current price, energy loss, and battery lifecycle costs, charging will be aborted as it would not be economically feasible.
economic_check=0

# Feed-in Tariff (feedin_price):
# This is the price you receive for feeding electricity back into the grid, typically from a solar PV system.
# The value is in cents per kWh and is used in calculations to determine if it's more economical to store energy in the battery or to sell it back to the grid.
# Example: If your feed-in tariff is 9.87 cents per kWh, set this value to 9.87.
feedin_price=9.87

# Energy Fee (energy_fee):
# This represents additional costs associated with electricity consumption, including taxes, levies, and other charges.
# The value is in cents per kWh and is added to the market price of electricity in economic calculations.
# This fee is particularly relevant when the market price of electricity is very low or zero, as these additional costs still apply.
# Example: If you pay an energy fee of 17 cents per kWh, including taxes and other charges, set this value to 17.0.
energy_fee=17.0

#######################
# Start/Stop Logic Settings
#######################

# Enable or disable specific logic controls:
# These settings control whether certain operations are based on start/stop logic or solar breakeven logic.
# Set to 1 to activate start/stop logic (depending start_price).
use_start_stop_logic=0
#Note: This functionality will be removed in the future in favour of economic_check and the price matrices.

# Price thresholds in cents/kWh:
# These values determine the price points at which different operations are triggered (net prices excl. tax).
# Note: Always use Cent/kWh, no matter if youre using Awattar (displaying Cent/kWh) or Entsoe API (displaying EUR/MWh).
start_price=-5.0   # Start operations below this price.
abort_price=50.1   # Abort operations if price exceeds this value (energy fees not included).

# This setting allows you to control additional devices (like a water heater) using AVM Fritz DECT200/210 or Shelly switchable sockets.
# 0 = Do not control additional devices based on start/stop logic.
# 1 = Enable control of additional devices based on start/stop logic.
# When enabled, this will activate or deactivate the switchable sockets based on the start/stop charging logic.
switchablesockets_at_start_stop=0

# This setting determines whether to charge your battery system when the cost of energy (including fees) is lower than your solar feed-in tariff.
# 0 = Do not charge based on solar breakeven logic.
# 1 = Enable charging when energy cost is lower than solar feed-in tariff.
# Enabling this will initiate charging when it's more economical to charge the battery than to feed the solar energy back into the grid.
charge_at_solar_breakeven_logic=0

# Similar to 'charge_at_solar_breakeven_logic', but for controlling switchable sockets.
# 0 = Do not control switchable sockets based on solar breakeven logic.
# 1 = Enable control of switchable sockets when energy cost is lower than solar feed-in tariff.
# When enabled, this will activate or deactivate the switchable sockets based on the comparison of current energy cost and solar feed-in tariff.

# Victron Venus OS Solar Charger Setup
#######################

# Enable or disable Victron Venus OS Solar Charger control:
# 1 = Control the charger, 0 = Do not control the charger.
use_victron_charger=1

# Energy loss percentage in the charging/discharging process:
# This value accounts for energy lost during charging and discharging of the battery.
energy_loss_percent=23.3

# Battery lifecycle cost per kWh in cents:
# Represents the cost associated with the battery's lifespan and usage.
battery_lifecycle_costs_cent_per_kwh=4.444444
# Note: If you are using a chinese 5KWh LifePo4 battery (4.5 KWh useable) with 6000 cycles and
# the rebuying price is at 1200 EUR, the calculation will be 1200*100/6000/4,5.

# disable_inverting_while_only_switching
# This setting controls the inverter's operation when switching (controlling additional loads) is active, but charging is deemed too expensive.
# 0 = Keep inverting enabled even when only switching is active. This means the inverter will continue to convert DC (battery) power to AC (household) power.
# 1 = Disable inverting when only switching is active and charging is too expensive. This helps to preserve the battery's full charge by not using it for inverter operation.
# Essentially, when set to 1, the system prioritizes maintaining battery charge over supplying AC power from the battery when charging is not economically feasible.
disable_inverting_while_only_switching=1

# limit_inverter_power_after_enabling
# This setting specifies a power limit for the inverter when it is re-enabled after being disabled.
# -1 = No limit. The inverter will operate at its full capacity when re-enabled.
# Any positive value (e.g., 1000) = Set a specific limit (in watts). For example, setting this to 1000 will limit the inverter's output to 1000 watts.
# This is useful if you have a 'Limit inverter power' setting configured in the Energy Storage System (ESS) menu and want to ensure it's respected after the inverter is re-enabled.
# Note: If 'disable_inverting_while_only_switching' is used, this setting ensures that your preferred inverter power limit is reinstated after inverting is re-enabled.
limit_inverter_power_after_enabling=-1
